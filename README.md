# Fun Retrospectives

![](https://github.com//Harmful-Alchemist/FunRetro/workflows/Elixir%20CI/badge.svg)

Having to work remotely sometimes you just want to throw some sticky notes, in couple of lanes/columns on a board. 
This project is an attempt to make that happen digitally.

It's a project build in elixir using phoenix. It uses a little of the phoenix liveview functionality.
